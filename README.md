## 🏗️ About InfraFix

**InfraFix** is a digital Public Infrastructure Issue Reporting System that allows citizens to report real-world public issues such as:

- Broken streetlights
- Potholes
- Water leakage
- Garbage overflow
- Damaged footpaths

Government staff and administrators can efficiently manage, verify, assign, and resolve reported issues using a centralized platform.

Municipal services often suffer from delayed response and lack of tracking. Citizens usually have no single platform to report problems.  
**InfraFix solves this by improving transparency, reducing response time, and making city service delivery more efficient.**
